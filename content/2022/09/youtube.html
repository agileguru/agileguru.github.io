<h2>Why Youtube Channel</h2>

<p class="text-responsive">

As a Senior Engineering Leader / SRE practitioner apart from writing blogs and papers, I am going to mentor other people. 
This includes hosting live video sessions and recordings of videos on varipus topics of interest. The topics will be on good software 
development practices using TDD / BDD methodolgy and Infrastructure as code (IAC). BY Using YouTube video I can ensure that the phrase 
"Picture says a thousand Words" can be accomplished effectively.
